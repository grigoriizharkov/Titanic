Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

All my work with this dataset - jupyter notebooks, submission files, dataset. 
Main branch will consist of jupyter notebook with the best result in a public leaderboard + appropriate submission .csv file. Other branches contain some experimental notebooks. Data folder consist of train and test .csv files. 

This competition let me to practise all ML stuff I learned so far, moreover, I managed to achive some succes in it - overcome "baseline" that was achived during studying. 

My final result in 0.79425, which allowed me to take the 779th/49768 (~top 2%) place in a public leaderboard.
