Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

All my work with this dataset - jupyter notebooks, submission files, etc. 
Main branch will consist of jupyter notebook with the best result in a public leaderboard + appropriate submission .csv file. Other branches contain some experimental notebooks. 

So, at the end of my work with this competition, I want to summarize all my thoughts and experience with it. It was very interesting to work with machine learning topic in the context of such an intriguing incident as Titanic Disaster. 

This competition let me to practise all ML stuff I learned so far, moreover, I managed to achive some succes in it - overcome "baseline" that was achived during studying. 

My final result in 0.79425, which allowed me to take the 779th/49768 (~top 2%) place in a public leaderboard.
